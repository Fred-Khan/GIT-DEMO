## 1. Configure Git User Settings

1. **Set your Git username**  
   üîß *Configures your global Git username (used in commits).*  
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   ```

2. **Set your Git email**  
   ‚úâÔ∏è *Configures your global Git email address (used in commits).*  
   ```bash
   git config --global user.email youremail@domain.com
   ```

3. **Set the default branch for new repositories**  
   üåø *Specifies the default branch name (`main`) for new repositories initialised with `git init`.*  
   ```bash
   git config --global init.defaultBranch main
   ```

---

## 2. Initialise a New Git Repository

4. **Initialise Git tracking in the current directory**  
   üöÄ *Starts a new Git repository in your project folder.*  
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

5. **Stage all changes for commit**  
   ‚ûï *Adds all files in the current directory to the staging area.*  
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

6. **Commit the staged changes**  
   üíæ *Commits your changes with a descriptive message.*  
   ```bash
   git commit -m "commit message"
   ```
   - **Commit Best Practices:** Write clear, descriptive commit messages (e.g., "Fix login bug when user enters invalid credentials") to ensure your project history is easy to understand.

7. **Rename the current branch to `main`**  
   üîÄ *Renames your branch to `main` to match modern best practices.*  
   ```bash
   git branch -M main
   ```

---

## 3. Connect to a Remote Repository

8. **Add a remote repository URL**  
   üåê *Associates your local repository with a GitHub repository.*  
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
   ```

9. **Pull changes from the remote repository**  
   ‚¨áÔ∏è *Synchronises your local repository with changes from the remote.*  
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

10. **Push your commits to GitHub**  
    ‚¨ÜÔ∏è *Uploads your local commits to the remote repository.*  
    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```

---

## 4. Advanced Git Operations: Merging, Resolving Conflicts, and Stashing

11. **Merge a branch into the current branch**  
    üîÄ *Merges changes from another branch into your current branch.*  
    ```bash
    git merge <branch-name>
    ```
    - *Example:* Merging a feature branch (`feature/login-page`) into `main` so that the new login functionality becomes part of your current code.

12. **Resolve merge conflicts**  
    üõ†Ô∏è *When conflicts occur, open the affected files, manually resolve sections marked by `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>`, then stage and commit changes:*  
    ```bash
    git add <file-name>
    git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict in <file-name>"
    ```

13. **Stash your changes temporarily**  
    üì¶ *Saves your modified tracked files without making a commit (useful if you need a clean working directory).*  
    ```bash
    git stash
    ```
    - To see your stashed changes:
      ```bash
      git stash list
      ```
    - To reapply the most recent stashed changes:
      ```bash
      git stash pop
      ```

## 5. Delete a Local Git Repository

Before deletion, **navigate to your project's root folder**.

### For Linux/macOS:
14. **Remove the `.git` folder**  
    üóëÔ∏è *Deletes all Git tracking data from the current project.*  
    ```bash
    rm -fr .git
    ```

### For Windows:
15. **Remove the `.git` folder**  
    üóëÔ∏è *Deletes all Git tracking data from the current project directory.*  
    ```cmd
    rmdir /s .git
    ```

16. **Verify deletion from the local repository**  
    üîç *Should display an error indicating absence of Git tracking (not a Git repository).*  
    ```bash
    git status
    ```
    *Expected output: `fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git`*

17. **(Optional) Reinitialise a new Git repository**  
    üöÄ *Creates a fresh Git repository, if needed.*  
    ```bash
    git init
    ```

## 6. Delete a Remote Git Repository on GitHub

Follow these steps on GitHub.com:

18. **Navigate to the repository's main page.**

19. **Click the "Settings" tab**  
    ‚öôÔ∏è *If the "Settings" tab is hidden, check the dropdown menu for it.*

20. **Scroll to the "Danger Zone" and select "Delete this repository."**

21. **Read the warnings carefully.**

22. **Confirm deletion by typing the repository name in the confirmation box.**

23. **Click "I understand the consequences, delete this repository."**

_For more details, see [GitHub's documentation on deleting a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/deleting-a-repository)._

## 7. Git Workflows

Understanding Git workflows can help tailor your process for different project needs. Here are common models with real-world examples:

- **Centralised Workflow:**  
  *All team members commit directly to a single central repository.*  
  - **Example:** A small startup where everyone pushes changes directly to the `main` branch of a central repository.
  
- **Feature Branch Workflow:**  
  *Develop new features in separate branches and merge into the main branch only when features are tested and complete.*  
  - **Example:** In a web application, developers create branches like `feature/user-authentication` or `feature/payment-integration` and later merge them into `main` after code review.
  
- **Forking Workflow:**  
  *Contributors fork the main repository, make changes in their own copy, and then submit pull requests to merge into the original repository.*  
  - **Example:** In an open-source project, external contributors fork the repo on GitHub, work on their feature branch, and create a pull request for review by the project maintainers.
  
- **Pull Request Workflow:**  
  *Often combined with feature branches; team members submit pull requests for their changes, which are then reviewed and merged by peers or maintainers.*  
  - **Example:** A large enterprise project where every change is subjected to code review via a pull request before merging into the central repository.

_Select the workflow that fits your team size and the complexity of your project._

## 8. Branching Strategies

Effective branching strategies help maintain a clean project history. Consider the following real-world strategies:

- **Feature Branching:**  
  *Create individual branches for new features.*  
  - **Example:** Create a branch named `feature/shopping-cart` when building an e-commerce app, and merge only after thorough testing.
  
- **Release Branching:**  
  *Maintain a branch dedicated to preparing for a new release.*  
  - **Example:** For a mobile app, maintain a `release/v2.0` branch to fix final bugs and prepare documentation before the official release.
  
- **Hotfix Branching:**  
  *Quickly address critical issues on the production branch without disrupting ongoing development.*  
  - **Example:** If a critical bug is found in production, create a `hotfix/critical-bug` branch to apply a fast patch and merge it back into both `main` and the development branch.
  
- **Trunk-Based Development:**  
  *Develop directly on a single branch (usually `main`) with small, frequent commits that are continuously integrated.*  
  - **Example:** In a continuous delivery environment, developers commit small changes directly to `main` while automated tests ensure stability.

_These strategies can be tailored to your project's size, release cadence, and team workflow._

## 10. Using Git in Team Collaboration

Collaborating in a team often means coordinating multiple remotes and ensuring everyone‚Äôs work is properly integrated. Here are some steps and tips for effective team collaboration:

1. **Forking vs. Shared Repository:**  
   - For small teams, use a shared repository where each collaborator has push access.  
   - For open-source or larger projects, use the forking model where each contributor works on their own copy and then submits pull requests.

2. **Adding Multiple Remotes:**  
   If you need to add a second remote (for example, to collaborate with another team or to sync with a backup repository), use:  
   ```bash
   git remote add collaborator https://github.com/otheruser/repo-name.git
   ```
   - *Use `git remote -v` to verify the list of remotes.*

3. **Coordinating Changes:**  
   - **Regular Pulls:** Always run `git pull origin main` before pushing any changes to avoid conflicts.  
   - **Peer Reviews:** Use pull requests and code review to improve code quality and maintain consistency across the team.
  
4. **Communication and Issue Tracking:**  
   - Use GitHub Issues, project boards, and discussion threads to track tasks and coordinate development efforts.
  
5. **Real World Example:**  
   - In a collaborative project, one developer pushes changes to `main` and another collaborator, working on a feature branch, regularly syncs their branch with `main`. Upon completion, a pull request is submitted, reviewed, and merged by a team lead ensuring that integration is smooth and conflicts are resolved rapidly.

## 11. Common Troubleshooting Tips for Git Beginners

- **Merge Conflicts:**  
  If you encounter conflicts, review markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`), resolve conflicts manually, then run:
  ```bash
  git add <file-name>
  git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict in <file-name>"
  ```
  
- **Detached HEAD:**  
  If you find yourself in a detached HEAD state, create a branch from your current commit:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
  ```
  
- **Accidental Commits:**  
  To undo a commit while keeping your changes staged:
  ```bash
  git reset --soft HEAD~1
  ```
  
- **Lost Changes:**  
  If you lose work after a hard reset or merge, use:
  ```bash
  git reflog
  ```
  to identify and recover commits. Then use:
  ```bash
  git checkout <commit-hash>
  ```
  
- **Not a Git Repository Error:**  
  Ensure you're operating within the project's root where Git tracking exists. Running:
  ```bash
  git status
  ```
  outside a Git-managed folder will return an error.
